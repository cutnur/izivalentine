                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>i used to think “home” was just a physical space—somewhere with four walls and a roof to keep the world out. but lately, i’ve realized that home is much more than that. it’s the quiet comfort of being understood and the steady presence of someone who makes everything feel a little less heavy. for me, that sense of home is found in you, izi.</p>
                    
                    <p>seeing how you’ve been handling everything lately honestly makes me so proud. you move through your days with so much dedication, even when things get overwhelming or exhausting. i hope you know that you’re doing so, so good, and the effort you put into everything you do doesn't go unnoticed. it’s really heartwarming to watch you grow and stay true to yourself through it all.</p>
                    
                    <p>i also want to remind you that you don’t always have to be the strong one. on the days when the world feels like a bit too much, i hope you can find that same sense of "home" and peace within yourself that you give to others. you’ve worked incredibly hard, and you deserve to take a moment to just breathe and realize how far you’ve actually come.</p>
                    
                    <p>moving forward, please know that i’ll always be in your corner. whether things are going perfectly or they’re a bit messy, i’m here to cheer you on and celebrate even the smallest wins with you. i’ll keep you in my prayers, hoping that your path is always cleared of obstacles and that you’re constantly surrounded by the kindness you deserve.</p>
                    
                    <p>more than anything, thank you for just being you. you bring a certain kind of light into my life that makes the tough days easier to navigate. have a beautiful day full of the same warmth you give to the world, and remember that i’m always rooting for you, no matter what.</p>
