                    <p>
                        selamat hari kasih, izi. i hope that on this day, you will get lots of love and happiness. i also hope that every bit of love and happiness you get today will stay with you eternally, aamiin—40 orang aminkan akan terwujud katanya (use your alter ego). 
                        <br><br>
                        i also hope you never forget that your presence brings its own kind of color to the people around you. amidst all the busyness and the tiring days, i hope you always find a reason to smile and feel at peace. you’ve been working so hard lately, so today, please take some time for yourself to feel the same love and care that you so often give to others.
                        <br><br>
                        beyond that, i hope we can continue to support each other through the small things in the future. it doesn’t have to be anything grand! just being there and listening to one another is more than enough. may every step you take be guided toward what truly makes you happy, and may the good things you’ve been wishing for slowly start to become a reality.
                        <br><br>
                        i really hope you know how much i value the way you handle things and how you stay true to yourself through everything. life can get pretty overwhelming, but seeing how you keep going is honestly so admirable! i hope today gives you the chance to breathe, recharge, and realize that you're doing amazing just by being who you are. you deserve all the kindness in the world, not just today, but every single day.
                        <br><br>
                        lastly, thank you for being a part of this journey. valentine’s day is just a reminder, but the truth is, my appreciation for you exists every other day of the year. have a beautiful day, and i hope the warmth you feel today doesn't fade even as the day changes.
